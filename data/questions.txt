What is the Sigmoid function, and how is it used in logistic regression?
Explain how the Sigmoid function addresses the limitations of using a linear regression model directly for binary classification.
Explain the process of training a logistic regression model using gradient descent. How does the derivative of the Sigmoid function play a role in this process?
